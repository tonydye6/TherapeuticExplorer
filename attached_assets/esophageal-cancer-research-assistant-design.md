## User Experience Design

### Conversational Interface

The primary interface will be a simple chat interface in Replit, allowing Matt to:
- Ask questions in natural language
- Upload documents or images for analysis
- Receive clear, organized responses
- Access saved information and previous conversations

#### Sample Interactions

**Question about Treatment:**
```
User: "What are the latest developments in immunotherapy for esophageal cancer with liver metastasis?"

THRIVE: Based on recent research, there are several promising developments in immunotherapy for metastatic esophageal cancer:

1. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has shown significant benefits in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, with recent studies showing improved survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone.

2. Combination approaches pairing immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies are showing promise in early trials, particularly for patients with liver metastasis.

3. Nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy received FDA approval for first-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Would you like me to provide more details on any of these approaches or search for clinical trials using these treatments?
```

**Document Analysis:**
```
User: [Uploads recent lab report]

THRIVE: I've analyzed your lab report from May 15th. Here are the key findings:

- Your liver function tests have improved since your previous test (ALT decreased from 65 to 48, AST from 72 to 52)
- Your hemoglobin remains slightly below normal range (11.2 g/dL)
- Your tumor markers show CA 19-9 has decreased by 15% since last measurement

These changes suggest your liver is responding positively to your current treatment. The decrease in tumor markers is also encouraging, though we should continue to monitor your hemoglobin levels.

Would you like me to compare these results with your previous labs to show trends over time?
```

### Dashboard Views

While the primary interface is conversational, structured information will be presented in organized dashboard views:

#### Treatment Dashboard
- Comparison tables of treatment options
- Efficacy and side effect visualizations
- Current treatment protocol and schedule

#### Research Library
- Organized collection of research findings
- Saved articles and summaries
- Custom collections by topic

#### Medical Timeline
- Chronological view of diagnosis and treatments
- Lab value trends over time
- Symptom tracking visualization
