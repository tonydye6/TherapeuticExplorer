Add a Non-Traditional Treatment Explorer module to THRIVE with the following capabilities:

1. Research and Analysis:
   - Connect to databases like the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)
   - Search PubMed for studies on complementary and alternative approaches specifically for esophageal cancer
   - Extract information from books and resources on alternative cancer treatments
   - Implement a specialized evidence rating system that accounts for different types of evidence in complementary medicine

2. Treatment Evaluation:
   - Create a database of complementary treatments including nutritional approaches, supplements, mind-body practices, traditional medicine systems, and emerging alternatives
   - Develop a specialized card interface for alternative treatments that includes:
     * Treatment description and background
     * Traditional usage and theoretical mechanism
     * Scientific evidence specific to cancer and/or esophageal cancer
     * Safety profile and known contraindications
     * Potential interactions with conventional treatments
     * Practitioner requirements (if applicable)
   - Implement a "compatibility checker" that flags potential interactions with conventional treatments

3. User Experience:
   - Design a filtering system allowing exploration by approach type, evidence level, and safety profile
   - Create visualization tools showing how alternative approaches might complement conventional treatment
   - Develop a special section for nutritional approaches with meal planning suggestions
   - Include a "patient experience" section that collects anecdotal reports while clearly distinguishing them from clinical evidence

4. Safety Features:
   - Implement prominent warnings about unproven approaches with high risk profiles
   - Include clear guidance on discussing all complementary approaches with healthcare providers
   - Provide specific interaction warnings when known
   - Highlight approaches endorsed by major cancer centers versus those without institutional support

Ensure the interface presents this information in a balanced way that neither dismisses complementary approaches nor overstates their efficacy beyond available evidence. The goal is to provide Matt with comprehensive, evidence-based information about all his options while emphasizing the importance of coordinating any approach with his medical team.
