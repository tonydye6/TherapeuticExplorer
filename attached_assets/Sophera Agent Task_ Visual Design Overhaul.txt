Sophera Agent Task: Visual Design Overhaul
Objective: Implement a complete visual redesign of the Sophera application UI to create a calm, hopeful, warm, and clean aesthetic, replacing the current generic/clinical look. Refer to sophera_ux_ui_design_doc for overall guidelines.
Target Audience: Replit Agent
Instructions:
1. Apply New Color Palette:
   * Globally update the application's color scheme.
   * Primary Backgrounds (Main Content Area): Use a very light, warm neutral (soft beige or off-white).
   * Sidebar/Navigation Background: Use a slightly darker warm neutral or a soft, muted primary color (calm blue or green).
   * Primary Interactive Elements (Buttons, Active States): Use the primary calm blue or green.
   * Accent Color (Hopeful): Use the gentle yellow or soft orange sparingly for key positive actions, highlights, or subtle decorative elements.
   * Text: Ensure high contrast. Use a dark gray or deep muted blue/green for body text, not pure black. Use primary/accent colors for links or key headings where appropriate.
   * Review: Check all pages in all_pages.pdf and apply the new palette consistently. Remove the stark white backgrounds and default blue accents.
2. Implement Typography:
   * Set the primary font globally to a legible, friendly sans-serif like "Inter" or "Nunito Sans". Ensure the font is imported correctly.
   * Establish a clear typographic hierarchy using font size and weight (e.g., larger, bolder headings; clear body text size like 16px; smaller helper text).
   * Increase line spacing (line-height) for body text to improve readability (e.g., 1.5-1.6).
   * Review: Check text on all pages for legibility, consistent font usage, and clear hierarchy. Replace default system fonts.
3. Refine Layout & Spacing:
   * Increase whitespace throughout the application. Add more padding within components (cards, buttons, list items) and margins between elements.
   * Reduce information density on screens identified as cluttered (e.g., AI Explainer - PDF pg 7, Treatment Guides - PDF pg 8).
   * Ensure consistent alignment and spacing rules are applied.
   * Review: Evaluate pages like the Dashboard (PDF pg 1), My Plan (PDF pg 2), AI Explainer (PDF pg 7) and ensure they feel less cramped and more breathable.
4. Implement Soft Edges & Updated Components:
   * Apply consistent, subtle rounded corners (e.g., border-radius: 8px; or similar) to all buttons, cards, input fields, modals, and main containers. Remove sharp edges.
   * Redesign standard buttons to use the primary color, have sufficient padding, clear text labels, and rounded corners. Add subtle hover/active states.
   * Update card components (e.g., Document cards - PDF pg 13, Trial cards - PDF pg 17) to use the new theme, rounded corners, and improved internal spacing.
5. Incorporate Subtle Visual Elements:
   * (Optional, if feasible) Consider adding very subtle background gradients (using the primary/neutral palette) or abstract background patterns/textures in key areas (like the dashboard or section headers) to add warmth without distraction.
   * Ensure all icons used are from a single, consistent, clean set (e.g., Material Symbols) and are sized appropriately. Review icons in the sidebar (PDF pg 1-6) and ensure consistency.
6. Sidebar Refinement:
   * Apply the designated sidebar background color.
   * Ensure consistent padding and spacing for navigation items.
   * Implement a clear but subtle active state indicator (e.g., background color change and/or left border) as defined in sophera_sidebar_design.
   * Implement the header (Sophera logo/name) and footer (Settings, User Profile, Logout) sections as described.
