Sophera Sidebar Design DetailsObjective: Describe the intended design and functionality of the primary sidebar navigation for desktop and tablet views of the Sophera application, aligning with the human-centric UX/UI guidelines.1. Placement & General Appearance:Position: Fixed on the left side of the screen.Width: Sufficiently wide to comfortably display icons and text labels, but not overly wide to dominate the screen (e.g., perhaps 200-280px).Background: Use a warm neutral color from the palette (e.g., soft beige or light gray) or potentially a subtle gradient incorporating the primary calm blue/green, distinct from the main content area background.Visual Style: Clean, uncluttered, soft edges (rounded corners on interactive elements).2. Header / Branding:Top: Display the "Sophera" name and/or logo prominently but elegantly at the top of the sidebar. Ensure it's clear but doesn't overwhelm the navigation items.3. Navigation Items (Core Sections):Structure: A vertical list of the main application sections.Items (Order Suggestion):Today (e.g., Icon: Home, Sun, or Sparkle)My Journey (e.g., Icon: Book, Path, Map Pin)Understand (e.g., Icon: Lightbulb, Magnifying Glass, Brain)Explore (e.g., Icon: Compass, Telescope, Binoculars)Connect & Hope (e.g., Icon: Heart, People, Seedling)Layout per Item:Each item should consist of an Icon and a clear Text Label (e.g., "Today", "My Journey").Icons should be clean, simple, and easily recognizable, sourced from a consistent icon set. Use a moderate, comfortable size.Text labels should use the primary legible sans-serif font, with a clear font size (e.g., 14-16px).Ensure adequate padding around each item to make it easily clickable/tappable and visually distinct.Align icon and text horizontally (icon on the left, text on the right).Spacing: Consistent vertical spacing between navigation items.4. Active State Indication:Clearly highlight the currently active/selected section. Methods include:Changing the background color of the active item (e.g., to a slightly darker shade of the primary blue/green or a contrasting accent color).Changing the text color and/or icon color of the active item.Adding a visual indicator like a vertical bar to the left of the active item.Using a combination (e.g., background highlight + bolder text).The indication should be obvious but not jarring, maintaining the overall calm aesthetic.5. Footer / User Section (Optional but Recommended):Bottom: Consider placing user-related items at the bottom, visually separated from the main navigation links (e.g., by a subtle horizontal line).Items:Settings: (e.g., Icon: Gear/Cog) - Link to the Settings & Profile page.User Profile: Display the user's name (e.g., "Matt Colligan") and potentially a simple avatar/initials. Clicking could lead to Settings/Profile or a logout option.Logout: Clear logout button/link.(Conditional) Caregiver Mode Indicator: If a caregiver is logged in, display a clear, persistent indicator here or at the top (e.g., "Caregiver Mode for [Patient Name]").6. Responsiveness:The sidebar should be the primary navigation on larger screens (tablet landscape, desktop).On smaller screens (mobile portrait/tablet portrait), the sidebar should collapse or be replaced entirely by the bottom tab bar navigation for better space utilization.Example Visual Structure (Conceptual):+-----------------------------+

| ... (Vertical Space) ...    |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+ <- Optional Separator
| [Icon] Settings             |
